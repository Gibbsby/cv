                <p>I am becoming a self-taught coder, to better myself at a career I'm interested in. I have been teaching myself from my teenage years to now. However, I stopped after I made my first pre-build anime website due to being uneducated. Honestly I had no idea how big the world of coding, and programming was, so I never took the chance to learn more. I started my learning back up last year, it's been almost 6 months. I am learning, I am able, I will succeed. I am taking a fullstack course on Udemy, to further my knowledge of programming.</p>
